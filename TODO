update delete tool to properly remove arcs

BACKLOG
-------

* fix symbol delete to also remove arcs that use it

* editor features
  * missing token +/- tool
  * missing edit dialog for updating symbol attributes
  * missing arc weight handle
  * add missing arc creation tool
    * should use a number positioned at midpoint in line as a clickable handle

* simulator (gui)
  * should only redraw pieces that have moved

* bugs (gui)
  * clearing/reseting the SVG seems to hang on android browsers: chrome & FF
  * moving symbols doesn't work in destkop FF
  * because refresh/redraw is so slow - deleting several elements causes error

* add link to Github in UI

refactor to allow PNML edit & simulation in browser

WIP
---

* from <saved>: fix bug (introduced by save?) where elements cannot be dragged
  * dragged symbol doesn't 'stick'

BACKLOG
-------

* from <counter>: delete all places and replace - result cannot run sim
  * seems like a name conflict - existing place names/states are not cleaned up

* add random firing simulation
  * need an async/background thread ?  https://www.brython.info/static_doc/en/asyncio.html

ICEBOX
------

* ? publish as chrome extension ?

* design other Brython/CLI features to surface for end user
  * some other petri-net tools allow for various kinds of analysis
    ? reachability ?
    ? boundedness ?
